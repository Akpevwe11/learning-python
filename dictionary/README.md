## Difference between a list and a dictionary in python

**List:**  

Ordered collection of items.
Items are accessed by their index, which is an integer starting from 0.
Allows duplicate elements.
Syntax: list_name = [item1, item2, item3]

**Dictionary:**

Unordered collection of key-value pairs.
Items are accessed by their key, which can be of any immutable type (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).
Keys must be unique.
Syntax: dict_name = {key1: value1, key2: value2, key3: value3}

A dictionary is a hashed structure of key value pairs. 

## Dictionary vs Tuples vs Sets 

**Tuple:** Tuple is a collection of Python objects much like a list. The sequence of values stored in a tuple can be of any type, and they are indexed by integers. The important difference between a list and a tuple is that tuples are immutable. 
Tuples are defined by enclosing the elements in parentheses (()) instead of square brackets ([]).

**Set:** Set is an unordered collection of unique items. Set is defined by values separated by a comma inside braces { }. 
Items in a set are not ordered.
