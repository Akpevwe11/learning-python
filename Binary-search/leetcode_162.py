Problem: Find Peak Element
A peak element in an array is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.
In other words, an element is a peak if it is greater than its neighbors.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time complexity.
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 1 or 5
Explanation: Your solution should be in logarithmic complexity.
Example 3:
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 0

Example 4:
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: 1
