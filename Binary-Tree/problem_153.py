Problem: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times.
For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:
[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] after some rotations.
Find the minimum element of this rotated sorted array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time complexity.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Example 3:
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
